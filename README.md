# StargazingCode
Map shows the best stargazing campsites and events in the San Francisco Bay Area. The map also has a layer of light pollution that can be toggled on or off to show the darkest skies throughout the bay. 

Sheffield Hale created the map. Jurij Stare created the light pollution layer.
Please ask permission to use light pollution data before forking and creating your own Stargazing map.
