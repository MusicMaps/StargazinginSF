# Stargazing Map
Shows the best stargazing campsites and events in the San Francisco Bay Area. [The map] (http://www.sfnaturemaps.org/stargazing.html) also has a layer of light pollution that can be toggled on or off to show the darkest skies throughout the bay.

See the final map [here] (http://www.sfnaturemaps.org/stargazing.html).

Sheffield Hale of the [SF Nature Mapping Project] (http://www.sfnaturemaps.org) created the map. Jurij Stare created the light pollution layer.
Please ask permission to use light pollution data before forking and creating your own map.
